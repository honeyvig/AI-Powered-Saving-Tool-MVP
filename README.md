# AI-Powered-Saving-Tool-MVP
Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our innovative AI-powered saving tool. This tool is designed to reward users for saving money while providing insights on how to reduce their spending. The ideal candidate will have experience in AI integration, user interface design, and financial application development. 
==============
To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your AI-powered saving tool, we can break it down into the following core components:

    User Registration & Input: Allow users to input their income, expenses, and savings goals.
    AI-driven Insights: Use AI algorithms to analyze user spending habits, and recommend savings tips and areas for improvement.
    Rewards System: Reward users based on their savings behavior or milestones.
    Simple User Interface (UI): Provide an interface for users to interact with the tool, display results, and manage goals.

Below is a Python code that integrates these components using Flask for the web framework, OpenAI for providing insights, pandas for data handling, and a simple rewards system.
Step 1: Install Dependencies

pip install flask openai pandas scikit-learn

Step 2: Code for Flask Backend

We will create a simple Flask app that allows users to input their data, generates insights using AI, and provides feedback.

import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
import openai
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key (replace with your actual key)
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Dummy database for user data (For production use, use a real database)
users_data = {}

# Home route to display the basic form for users to input financial data
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

# Function to calculate savings goal (simple calculation)
def calculate_savings_goal(income, expenses):
    savings_goal = income - expenses
    return savings_goal if savings_goal > 0 else 0

# AI-driven insights function (using OpenAI to suggest savings tips)
def ai_spending_analysis(income, expenses):
    prompt = f"Analyze the spending habits of a user with an income of {income} and expenses of {expenses}. Suggest ways to save money and improve their financial habits."
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can replace with other models
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to calculate user rewards based on savings
def calculate_rewards(savings_goal):
    if savings_goal > 1000:
        reward = "Gold Member - 10% Discount"
    elif savings_goal > 500:
        reward = "Silver Member - 5% Discount"
    else:
        reward = "Bronze Member - 2% Discount"
    return reward

# Route to handle user data submission
@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    # Get data from form
    income = float(request.form['income'])
    expenses = float(request.form['expenses'])
    
    # Calculate savings goal
    savings_goal = calculate_savings_goal(income, expenses)
    
    # Get AI insights
    insights = ai_spending_analysis(income, expenses)
    
    # Calculate rewards
    rewards = calculate_rewards(savings_goal)
    
    # Store user data (In production, save it to a database)
    user_id = len(users_data) + 1
    users_data[user_id] = {
        "income": income,
        "expenses": expenses,
        "savings_goal": savings_goal,
        "insights": insights,
        "rewards": rewards
    }
    
    # Render results
    return render_template('result.html', 
                           income=income,
                           expenses=expenses,
                           savings_goal=savings_goal,
                           insights=insights,
                           rewards=rewards)

# Running the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Creating the HTML Templates

Now, let's create the HTML files for basic user interaction.
templates/index.html (Home Page)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>AI-Powered Saving Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the AI-Powered Saving Tool</h1>
    <form action="/submit" method="POST">
        <label for="income">Monthly Income: </label>
        <input type="number" id="income" name="income" required><br><br>
        
        <label for="expenses">Monthly Expenses: </label>
        <input type="number" id="expenses" name="expenses" required><br><br>
        
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

templates/result.html (Results Page)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Savings Results</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Your Savings Summary</h1>
    <p>Monthly Income: ${{ income }}</p>
    <p>Monthly Expenses: ${{ expenses }}</p>
    <p>Suggested Savings Goal: ${{ savings_goal }}</p>
    
    <h2>AI Insights:</h2>
    <p>{{ insights }}</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rewards:</h2>
    <p>{{ rewards }}</p>
    
    <br><br>
    <a href="/">Go back to input page</a>
</body>
</html>

Step 4: Running the Flask App

    Save the above Python code in a file, e.g., app.py.
    Make sure you have your OpenAI API key and add it in the appropriate line.
    To run the app, execute:

python app.py

    Open a browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the tool.

Features of the MVP:

    User Input: Users input their income and expenses.
    AI Insights: The AI (OpenAI) analyzes spending habits and provides actionable savings recommendations.
    Rewards: Based on savings goals, users are assigned a reward (Gold, Silver, or Bronze).
    Simple UI: The user interface provides an easy form for input and shows results on a new page.

Step 5: Future Enhancements

    Data Visualization: Add charts to visualize income, expenses, and savings trends.
    Database Integration: Store user data in a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Google Sheets.
    Advanced AI Recommendations: Use more sophisticated AI models to predict future expenses and offer long-term savings strategies.
    Mobile App: Develop a mobile version for easy user access and notifications.
    Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment gateway for real-time tracking of actual savings through bank transactions.

This is a basic MVP that can be further developed as per the needs of your AI-powered saving tool. It covers core functionality like user input, AI insights, rewards, and a simple UI.
